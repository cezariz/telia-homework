## Requirements
    Telia Homework
    1. Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and find out posts, comments, users REST API
    resources
    2. Create a backend service with your favorite framework and provide one GraphQL endpoint to
    query the resources above. Providing GraphQL playground is good enough. You do not need to
    create UI for your backend.
    3. We prefer Koltin and Ktor but you are not limited.
    4. We are looking at your documentation, code quality, commits history, performance and
    optimization.
